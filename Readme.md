# Cohere & Azure AI Search RAG Demo  

![RAG Architecture](assets/cohererag.png)

   
Welcome to the Cohere & Azure AI Search Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) demo! This project showcases how to leverage Cohere Embed V3 for generating int8 and binary embeddings, significantly reducing memory costs while maintaining high search quality. These embeddings are integrated with Azure AI Search to perform RAG using CommandR+ in Azure AI Studio.

## Introduction  
   
Semantic search over large datasets can require a lot of memory, which is expensive to host in a vector database. For example, searching across all of Wikipedia‚Äôs data requires storing 250 million embeddings. With 1024 dimensions per embedding and each dimension as float32 with 4 bytes, you will need close to 1 TB of memory on a server.

## Features  
   
- **Memory Optimization**: Use int8 and binary embeddings to reduce memory usage by up to 32x.  
- **High Search Quality**: Maintain 90-99.99% of the original search quality.  
- **Multi-Language Support**: Supports multiple languages for diverse applications.  
- **Integration with Azure AI Search**: Seamlessly integrate with Azure AI Search for advanced RAG capabilities.  
- **Compression-Friendly Embedding Model Training**: Ensures superior search quality even with vector space compression.
